This is an experimental fork of cperl-mode.el which we made to fix
some long-term problems with the mode which didn't seem to be being
addressed by the various maintainers of cperl-mode.el.

Fixes so far:

* Emacs no longer produces an error message every time the "m" or "s"
  key is pressed in perl mode. This was a new bug introduced into
  recent versions of the mode and/or Emacs.

* The "far-right" indentation of qw and qr!!x has been fixed (requires
  setting sane-perl-indentable-indent nil)

No longer

my @array = qw!
                  far
                  right
                  indentation
              !;

Now indents as

my @array = qw!
    normal
    indentation
!;

(This fix comes from the jrockway fork of cperl-mode:

https://github.com/jrockway/cperl-mode/pull/54

Although the fix predates the fork of sane-perl-mode, this fix hadn't
been applied in the HaraldJoerg fork which sane-perl-mode originates
from. Further to the jrockway fork fix, sane-perl-mode also puts the
indentation of the !; at the end on the left rather than under the
final line, as shown above. The jrockway fork currently does the
following:

my @array = qw!
    normal
    indentation
    !;

)

* Tests of the qw!! and qr!!x behaviours have been added in the t/
  directory. These run Emacs in batch mode and then compare the
  results using Perl's Test::More framework.

* The Moose and other module-specific additions to the mode, and the
  editorial comments about the future of Perl development have been
  removed.

* Spelling mistakes have been fixed and some attempt made to tone down
  the level of bonkers-ness of the documentation (ALL CAPS YOU MUST DO
  THIS type of statements).

* Untabifying by delete was switched off. We might switch this back on
  again, depending on whether users expect this behaviour.
