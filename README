This is an experimental fork of cperl-mode.el which I made to fix some
long-term problems with the mode which didn't seem to be being
addressed by the various maintainers of cperl-mode.el.

Fixes so far:

* Emacs no longer produces an error message every time the "m" or "s"
  key is pressed in perl mode.

* The "far-right" indentation of qw and qr!!x has been fixed (requires
  setting sane-perl-indentable-indent nil)

No longer

my @array = qw!
                  far
                  right
                  indentation
!;

Now indents as

my @array = qw!
    normal
    indentation
!;

* The moose and other module-specific additions to the mode, and the
  editorial comments about the future of Perl development have been
  removed.

So far I don't have tests of the new behaviours.
