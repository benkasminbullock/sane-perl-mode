I've been using Emacs Perl mode for over twelve years, and have yet to
see anyone do anything about any of the bugs which have been there all
the time I have been using it, many of them really extremely daft bugs
like highlighting @ within '' strings.

Not only that, but whoever is maintaining the cperl-mode.el seems to
be adding more strange behaviours to the mode, to the point that
HERE-docs are virtually unuseable, requiring me to restart perl mode
again and again, or Emacs violently jerks the window due to a
completely barmy error message every time I type an "m" or an "s", so
I can't type "sub" or "my" in Emacs any more without this horrible
jerk-scroll.

Anyway, the jerk-scroll was the final straw, I can't stand any more of
this insanity, so here is my fork, "sane-perl-mode.el".
